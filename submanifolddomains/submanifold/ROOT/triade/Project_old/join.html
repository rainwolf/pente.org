	<H1>Joining the project</H1>

	There are no deadlines for this project since it's not funded :-), 
	no seriously, this is a typical leisure/long time project, we code when we feel like it.  
	But, and here it comes, we need some help, we are currently looking for:
	<BR>

	<UL>
		<LI>Someone with an expert knowledge of the linux operating system, or with an expert knowledge of the multi-user concept of the linux operating system who is inexhaustable to answer all our (stupid) linux questions.
	</UL>


	If you are interested in joining this project or if you just want to learn more about it, 
	you can contact us at this address:
