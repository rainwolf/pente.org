X 1. update dns on current pente.org to lower refresh times to 5 min

X 2. create new dns record for test2.pente.org pointing to new machine ip

3. setup new pente.org machine software
  a. snmp, snmpd, mrtg, apache2
  xb. ntp
  xc. tomcat6
  xd. mysql
  d2. mysql2
  xe. bind9
    just a copy of dns files from current pente.org
    update ns2.pente.org to new.pente.org address
    can release that any time
    
  e1. also, add records for ns1.hewittsoft.com, ns2.hewittsoft.com
    after a couple of days can switch name servers to those for clients
  
  f. qmail2
  xg. pente.org app as test2.pente.org
  xh. hostname
  i. start scripts
  j. backups to current pente.org
  k. java [upgrade 6u10?], include dns hack code?
  
4. test pente.org app

5. edit dns to make the switch official



Once make the switch, ask sago to provide correct reverse dns listing
Actually ask them if they can do it earlier than that or not

Make current machine hostname hewittsoft.com and reverse dns also
  And notify HIRB related company about change for TLS
