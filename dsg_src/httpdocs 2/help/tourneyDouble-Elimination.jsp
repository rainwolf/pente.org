<h2>Double-Elimination</h2>

 <ol>
   <li>All players signed up for a tournament will be seeded by their
       Pente.org rating.</li>
   <li>For round 1, if there are an odd number of players, the highest
       seed will get a bye.</li>
   <li>For round 1, all players are placed in Bracket 1.  Matches are
       assigned the same as in a single-elimination tournament, by
       placing the #1 seed vs. #last seed, then #2 seed  vs. #2nd-to-last
       seed, etc.</li>
   <li>Players play one game as white, one game as black (a set).  If
       the players tie, another set is played, this continues until 
       one player wins a set.</li>
   <li>In the second round, the winners remain in Bracket 1, the losers
       move to Bracket 2.  Then for each bracket individually, the
       process of assigning a bye to a player if necessary, and then assigning
       matches based on seeds is followed.  If however, 2 players are
       assigned a match but have already played earlier in the tournament,
       Pente.org will try to find another pairing that haven't played yet, but
       that is still close to the system of pairing by seeds.</li>
   <li>After the second round, the winners in each bracket remain in the
       same bracket, the losers of Bracket 1 move down to Bracket 2, and
       the losers of Bracket 2 are out of the tournament.</li>
   <li>Eventually there will be only one undefeated player in Bracket 1,
       when that happens, the two Brackets are combined for the
       rest of the tournament.</li>
   <li>Play continues until only one player is left without getting
       two losses, that player is the winner of the tournament. Note that
       if the undefeated player from Bracket 1 loses at this point, he/she
       is still in the tournament.  So it is possible that the
       last two rounds have the same two players.  For example, in the first of
       the two, player 1 has zero losses, then player 2 wins, then
       player 1 and 2 both have 1 loss so neither is eliminated and neither
       is the winner yet either.
