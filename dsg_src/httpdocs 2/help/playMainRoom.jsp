<a name="chat"><u>Chat with all players</u></a><br>
You can chat with other players in the main room.  There are 2
boxes at the bottom left of the screen.  The upper box displays all chat messages
and the bottom box allows you to type in messages to all other players.  To send
your chat message, just type <b>Enter</b> on your keyboard.<br>
<br>
<a name="playerList"><u>See who is logged in currently</u></a><br>
You can see all the players who are currently logged into
the game room in the player listing to the right.  By double-clicking on a
player's name, you can view the player's game statistics in a popup window.<br>
<br>
<a name="options"><u>Configure some options</u></a><br>
Click the Options button to configure a few things in the game room.  These
options will be stored on the pente.org server so you only have to set them up
once. Current options allow you to:
<ul>
 <li>Have a bell ring when a new player joins the game room</li>
 <li>Have a timestamp displayed on all chat messages</li>
 <li>Have text notifications of players joining and exiting the game room</li>
</ul>
Also note that the timestamp and text notification options will apply to both
the main room and each game table you are in.<br>
<br>
<a name="serverStats"><u>View Server Stats</u></a><br>
If you click the <b>Server Stats</b> button you can view
statistics about the server, such as how long the server has been running, how
many games have been played in that time, the maximum number of players on at
one time, etc.  The statistics will be displayed in a popup window.<br>
<br>
<a name="createTable"><u>Create a Game Table</u></a><br>
To play games you need to play in a Game Table. If you want to start a new
table click the <b>Create New Table</b> button, this will open a new window.
You can create as many tables as you'd like. Or you can join another
players table, see the next section.<br>
<br>
<a name="gameTable"><u>Join a Game Table</u></a><br>
In the upper left of the screen there are sections for each game table. This
area of the screen shows the game, who is playing in the table, who is
watching, and if the game is rated or not, and the time controls for the table.
To join the table click the <b>Join</b> button.  If the table is private, you
will not be able to join unless you are invited. You
can join more than 1 table at once!<br>
