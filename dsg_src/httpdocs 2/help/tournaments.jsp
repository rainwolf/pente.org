<h2>Tournaments</h2>

Tournaments are held from time to time, lately dweebo has been trying to
hold more regular tournaments.  There are two types of tournaments played.<br>
<br>
There are <b>Speed tournaments</b>
which consist of speed games (generally less than 5
minutes).  These tournaments are held live and complete in a few hours.<br>
<br>
Then there are <b>Long tournaments</b>,
which have 20-30 minute game timers.  These are still live games, but the 
tournaments usually take several months, with each
round lasting 2 weeks to allow enough time for players to coordinate their match
times.  You can view past tournament results, signup for tournaments, and learn
more about tournaments in the <b><a href="/gameServer/tournaments">Tournaments</a></b>
area.<br>
