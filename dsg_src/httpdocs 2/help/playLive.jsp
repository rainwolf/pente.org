<h2>Playing Live Games</h2>

Playing in the game rooms is the most exciting and most used feature.
In the game room you can play other players, chat with friends, watch games in 
progress that other players are playing, and play in a game against a computer
opponent (all at the same time if you want)!<br>
<br>
To start playing in the game rooms, you need to click <b>Join Game Room</b> from
the main page and a new window will open.  The game room is a java applet and 
will take a few minutes to load up the first time you play.

For more information on the how to play in the game room read the following
