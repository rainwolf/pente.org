<h2>Rated Game Policy</h2>

Pente.org maintains a rating for you when you play "rated"
games (either live or turn-based).  The ratings system is important to help
you determine your skill level and to help you find
worthy opponents.  Pente.org attempts to ensure that ratings
accurately reflect a players skill, and therefore
certain guidelines must be followed by all players!<br>
<ol>
 <li>Play rated games using only your brain.  Do no play
with any outside assistance.  Just to be clear,
here are some examples of what you should NOT do: use
another pente board to examine future positions, use a
game database to lookup the current or future
positions, use a computer opponent to find moves,
consult written notes or books.</li>
 <li>Play rated games with only one user account.
Do not create multiple users and play rated
games with them.</li>
 <li>When playing games, you can request to undo
your last move, your opponent can choose to accept or deny this request (Pente.org 
does not care, it is up to you).  If you do not plan to accept undo's, you
should mention this to your opponent before starting a rated game.</li>
 <li>When watching a rated game, do not make comments about specific game moves,
this could affect the outcome of the game.  There is plenty of time for analysis
after the game.</li>
 <li>If your opponent is disconnected from the internet, Pente.org allows him/her 7
minutes to return to resume the game.  After that point you may decide to cancel
the game or force your opponent to resign.  This feature was implemented to
stop other players from bailing out of a losing game.  However, do not abuse this
feature, if you are sure you will lose, you should resign the game.  Do not
force your opponent to resign unless you are absolutely sure you will win.</li>
</ol>

That's it, and remember to have fun of course!<br>
