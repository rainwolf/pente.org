<h2>Playing</h2>

At Pente.org you can play live games in real-time or you can play turn-based games that span
days or weeks!  <a href="helpWindow.jsp?file=playLive">Live games</a> are played in
the game rooms where multiple players log in and chat/play.<br>  
<a href="helpWindow.jsp?file=playTb">Turn-based games</a> are great for playing when you don't have much time
to get on and play, or want to really analyze each move in detail.
