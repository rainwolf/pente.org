Pente.org is a free site run entirely with the support of player donations.  Running
this complex site is not cheap and luckily our users have been generous enough
to keep it running so far.  If you have enjoyed the site for awhile, please
consider donating a few dollars.
 If you donate at least $5 you will get the following special features enabled 
 for your profile:<br>
- Change the color of your name in the game room!<br>
- Upload a picture of yourself to your profile!<br>
- Add a note to your profile!<br>
