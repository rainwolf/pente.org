                <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
                Pente.org is a free site, and I do not make
                any money from the site.  All proceeds from donations and advertising is
                used to further develop the site.<br>
                <br>
                This site continues to be developed solely by dweebo (<a href="http://dweebos.com/">Peter Hewitt</a>), but with
                contributions from a few other people.  Most notably, Mark Mammel
                has really helped out Pente.org by contributing his excellent Pente
                AI that players can practice against and also providing some
                key code that runs the Games Database, thanks Mark! 
                And I have a few great admins [partica, up2ng] who help run
                the place.  And thanks to karlw for running some tournaments in
                the past.  I'd also like to thank Greg Strange for his work on the Tutorials!<br>
                <br>
                The site has been hosted on several servers over the years, and has
                stayed up thanks to <b><a href="donations">donations</a></b> from
                many people.  Thanks to everyone who has donated!<br>

                I started this site back around 05/1999.&nbsp; I first played Pente 
                with my brother.&nbsp; However, he lives quite far away, so I 
                thought maybe we could play on the internet.&nbsp; But I wasn't 
                able to find any place online where we could play in real time.&nbsp; 
                Well, seeing as how I was studying to be a computer scientist, I 
                thought I'd play around and see what I could do.&nbsp; I'm still working on it!  
                In creating this site I've learned java extremely well, 
                (this site is written with 100% java!) and am now
                a java 2 certified programmer.<br>
