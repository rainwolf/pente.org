 ></a>Thread Mode</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Sets the default thread display mode. 
    <ul>
    <li>Flat mode (default), shows all
    messages in a thread in an un-indented, multi-page list. This mode is
    familiar to many users, and is good for large, active conversations.
    <li>Threaded mode shows all messages on a single page and indented
    appropriately to indicate which messages are replies to other messages.
    This mode is useful when it's important for users to be able to easily
    track how messages are related to each other, while still being able to
    see many messages at once.
    <li>Tree mode displays a single message per page with links to other
    messages below. This mode is useful for in-depth discussions where it's
    important to easily track how messages are related.

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    When this feature is enabled, information about the person who made the
    last post in a thread is displayed on the thread summary page. You may
    wish to disable this feature if your UI layout doesn't leave room for
    this information.

    <font size="-1">
    If you use an external user database, you may wish to disable account
    creation links inside the forums since you'll likely already have your own
    registration process.

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    When enabled, the IP address of the poster will be saved as an extended
    property of each message. You can use this information to verify the
    identity of users or to take action against misbehaving users.

<font size="-1"><b><a name="choose_locale" style="text-decoration:none;"

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Specify whether users should be able to choose a custom locale setting
    in their account settings. If user's aren't allowed to choose their own
    locale, the global locale will be used. The locale controls how dates
    and numbers are formatted, as well as what language the UI of the forums
    is displayed in (if a translation for the particular locale is available).

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    (Professional and Enterprise Only) Choose the read tracking mode that should
    be used. Simple read tracking uses the last time the user visited the forums
    to flag content as new. Advanced read tracking keeps track of
    the individual threads and messages a user has viewed, which provides a
    better browsing experience. However, this tracking incurs a higher
    database load, so isn't appropriate for large communities.
