 ></a>Host (inbound)</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    The host that Jive should connect to for retrieving email messages
    for this forum.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="inboundusername" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>POP3 account username</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Enter the username associated with the mailbox this gateway is going to retrieve
    messages from. Often this is the first portion of an email address (the 'test' in
    test@testing.com).

<font size="-1"><b><a name="inboundport" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Server Port</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    POP3 servers by default are configured to use port 110. It is possible however
    that the server may be configured to use another port. If that is the case, you
    can configure the email gateway to use that port when connecting to the POP3
    server by setting this property.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="delete" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Delete messages from server</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Normally the email gateway will leave messages on the POP3 server instead of
    automatically deleting them upon retrieval. However, if the gateway is the only
    mail client that retrieves messages from the server, you should configure the
    gateway to delete the messages so that message retrieval is fast and server
    resources are conserved. In the case of POP3, this is especially the case since
    the gateway always downloads every message on the server before deciding which
    messages to import.

</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="attachments" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Allow import/export of attachments</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will allow this gateway to import and export attachments
    to messages. Importing of attachments will honor any attachment settings you have made.
    <br><i>Note: importing of attachments that cross multiple messages is not supported</i>
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="subjectcheck" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Enabled threading via subject line matching</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will allow this gateway to attempt to create threads through
    matching the subject line with subject lines of messages already imported in the last 60
    days. This is a fall back method of threading when the primary method of using the threading
    headers that normally occur in mail messages are not found.<p>

    Subject line matching will only occur is the subject of the message being imported starts
    with "re:" (case ignored, configurable). If that is not the case, threading via subject line
    matching will not occur.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="tempparent" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Temporary Parent Body</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    It's possible with email accounts, mailing lists and newsgroups to get a response
    to a message before getting the original message. If this happens and only the
    child message is available at the time of the gateway import, Jive must still have
    a way to establish a correct parent/child relationship. Therefore, a temporary fake
    parent message is created using an extrapolated subject from the child, and a body
    with the value given by this property. By default, this value will be an empty
    string. However, you may wish to create a short message that explains the nature of
    the fake parent message to the user.<br>
    On subsequent imports when a real parent message is found, the fake data will be
    replaced with the correct subject and body.

</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="debug" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Debug</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will cause the email gateway to output debugging
    information to the standard output stream. Where that stream show up depends on
    your application server, but often it shows up either on the console or in a file
    called stdout.log
    </font>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="outboundport" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>SMTP Server Port</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    SMTP servers by default are configured to use port 25 for connections. It is
    possible however that the SMTP server may be configured to use another port. If
    that is the case, you can configure the email gateway to use that port when
    connecting to the SMTP server by setting this property.

<font size="-1"><b><a name="outboundssl" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>SSL</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    If the SMTP server the email gateway is configured to connect to requires a SSL
    encrypted connection, you can configure the email gateway to use SSL when
    connecting to the SMTP server by setting this property.
    <br><i>Note: The gateway SSL support does not validate the certificates the
    SMTP server provides. This means that you should be certain about the
    server you are connecting to before setting this property to true.</i>

    Email messages can have an "Organization" header set which will show up in many

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will cause this gateway to only use the 'Default
    "From" address' property to fill the from field in outbound emails - ignoring
    all user email addresses and settings. The property defaults to false.

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true (the default) will cause this gateway to honor user
    preferences to either show or hide their email address depending on the user
    preferences. If the user chooses to not show their email address and this property
    is set to true, the email gateway will use the 'Default "From" address' property as
    the from address. Setting this property to false will use the user's email address
    as the from address regardless of the users preferences.

    Setting this property to a date in the format of dd/mm/yyyy will cause the gateway to
    export messages that have a creation date as old or older than the date specified. One
    note is that the gateway will export a whole thread if any of the messages in the thread
    meet the date criteria. This is done so that the consistency of the thread is preserved.

    Setting this property to true will cause the gateway to update the messageID message
    property stored in Jive upon export of a message. By default, the messageID is stored
