    Interceptors are actions run on messages before they are added to the system.
    An interceptor can either modify the message or reject it from being posted.<p>
    
    The list of installed interceptors shows you which interceptors
    are currently enabled. Some interceptors have additional properties that can be set. You can edit
    these properties by clicking the edit icon.

    <font size="-1">
    New interceptors created by you or by third parties can be dynamically added to
    the system so that they are available for installation. Enter the Java
    class name of the interceptor such as com.foo.interceptors.XYZInterceptor and then add it.
    Jive Forums will attempt to load the named class. If this succeeds, the
    interceptor will be added to the list of interceptors available for installation. If
    loading the interceptor fails, you'll be notified of the error.
