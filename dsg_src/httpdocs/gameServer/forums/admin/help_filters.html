    Filters dynamically format the contents of messages for end-users. For
    example, the HTML filter removes potentially malicious HTML and scripting,
    and the Newline filter converts linefeeds to HTML newlines for proper
    display in a browser. The list of installed filters shows you which filters
    are currently enabled, as well as their order. The order of filters is
    important since the flow of control passes through them from the top down.
    A good rule of thumb is to always have the HTML filter installed as the
    first filter, and the Newline filter installed as the last (except for
    the JavaCodeHighlighter filter, which should come after Newline). You can
    adjust the order of filters using the up and down arrows.<p>

    Some filters have additional properties that can be set. You can edit
    these properties by clicking the edit icon.

    The install filter dialog shows you the list of filters that are available
    for installation. Click each filter in the list for more information about

    New filters created by you or by third parties can be dynamically added to
    the system so that they are available for installation. Enter the Java
    class name of the filter such as com.foo.filter.XYZFilter and then add it.
    Jive Forums will attempt to load the named class. If this succeeds, the
    filter will be added to the list of filters available for installation. If
    loading the filter fails, you'll be notified of the error.
