Jive Forums 3 - PJA Documentation
</span>
<hr size="0">

<p>
In UNIX, Java requires the use of the display to create images. This is a
limitation of the Java AWT libraries that is fixed in the new JDK 1.4 release.
Until then there are two possible solutions for applications such as
Jive Forums, which run in a Java application server. It is possible to set the
<tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable and have a writeable display that Java can
use. However, this is not a good solution for most servers as it creates
security problems and is an ungainly solution at best. The solution we recommend
is the use of a toolkit such as PJA (Pure Java AWT).
</p>

<p>
Before you attempt to install PJA, please run the Server-Side Graphics Capability
test on the Report Configuration page of the Jive Forums Admin tool. This test
will determine if you need to install PJA.
</p>

<span class="subheader">
General Java Setup
</span>

<p>
To use PJA, you'll first need to download the latest release from
<a href="http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/" target="_new">http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/</a>.
For purposes of this example installation, we'll assume you have Java installed
in <tt>/opt/java</tt> and an application server
installed in <tt>/opt/&lt;appServer&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Extract the <tt>pja_2.4.zip</tt> file.
    <li>Locate the pja.jar file in the newly created directory <tt>pja_2.4/lib</tt>
    <li>Copy pja.jar to a usable location (we'll use <tt>/opt/&lt;appServer&gt;/lib</tt> for this
        example)
</ol>

<p>
To add the <tt>pja.jar</tt> file to your "bootclasspath" directory
you will need to set three Java system properties that will allow your
application server's Java instance to find and use PJA properly.  If you wish
to set these options on the command line as arguments to the java executable,
it would look like the following (ignore the backslashes, they are there to
represent that the newline is irrelevant):
</p>

<pre>
java -Xbootclasspath/a:/opt/&lt;appServer&gt;/lib/pja.jar     \
   -Dawt.toolkit=com.eteks.awt.PJAToolkit               \
   -Djava.awt.fonts=/opt/java/jre/lib/fonts             \
   -Djava.awt.graphicsenv=com.eteks.java2d.PJAGraphicsEnvironment
</pre>

<span class="subheader">
Specific Application Server Setup
</span>

<p><i>Resin</i></p>

<ul>
    For this example, we'll assume you have Resin installed at <tt>/opt/resin</tt>.
    With Resin, the application server is started using a command line program. The
    arguments above can be added to our command line, however resin requires you to
    prepend each argument with a "-J" that specifies that the argument should be
    passed to Java directly. An example Resin command line could look like this:

    <pre>
    /opt/resin/bin/httpd.sh start -J-Xbootclasspath/a:/opt/resin/lib/pja.jar \
       -J-Dawt.toolkit=com.eteks.awt.PJAToolkit                              \
       -J-Djava.awt.fonts=/opt/java/jre/lib/fonts                            \
       -J-Djava.awt.graphicsenv=com.eteks.java2d.PJAGraphicsEnvironment
    </pre>
</ul>

<p><i>Tomcat 4.x</i></p>
<ul>
    In Tomcat 4, setup is easy to do. In the <tt>tomcat4.conf</tt> file, simply add
    a line that looks like this (it is assumed Tomcat is installed at
    <tt>/opt/tomcat4</tt>):
    <p>
    <pre>
    CATALINA_OPTS="$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -Xbootclasspath/a:/opt/tomcat4/lib/pja.jar   \
        -Dawt.toolkit=com.eteks.awt.PJAToolkit              		       \
        -Djava.awt.fonts=/opt/java/jre/lib/fonts             		       \
        -Djava.awt.graphicsenv=com.eteks.java2d.PJAGraphicsEnvironment"
    </pre>
</ul>

<p>
Under other application servers these setting can be made from GUI configuration
tools. In JRun, for instance, you are given a web based administration page.
Under the "Java Settings" section you are allowed to add Java arguments.
That is where you'd want to put the arguments described above.
</p>
