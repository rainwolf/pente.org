    Many of the reports that Jive Forums comes with includes graphs and charts
    which must be generated on the server. This test test to see if your environment
    supports the creation of graphics on your server.<p>

    In UNIX, Java requires the use of the display to create images. This is a
    limitation of the Java AWT libraries that is fixed in the JDK 1.4 release.
    However many situations require the use older JDK's which do not support the
    'headless' mode that is required. There are two possible solutions for applications
    such as Jive Forums, which run in a Java application server. It is possible
    to set the <tt>DISPLAY</tt> environment variable and have a writeable display that
    Java can use. However, this is not a good solution for most servers as it creates
    security problems and is an ungainly solution at best. The solution we recommend
    is the use of a toolkit such as PJA (Pure Java AWT).

    Report information is not dynamically generated on demand and so must be
    stored on the file system to be later viewed through a web browser. By default,
    reports are written to your jiveHome directory so you will need to browse
    your filesystem in order to view them. You may wish to enter an
    alternative directory that is in the path of your webserver documents directory
    so that the reports are publicly viewable.

    Oftentimes reports on certain forums are not required and thus can be left out of
    report generation process. This will cause these forums to not be included in the
    reports and also speeds up the report generation process.

    You may wish to not run reports on users or groups, especially if you have a
    customer user or group implementation. User reports are reports that detail
    things like active users, users created over time or user domains.

    You can set a global date range to restrict the size of data being examined. This is useful
    if you have a large amount of category traffic because examining all data will take
    a long time and will increase your database load quite a bit.
