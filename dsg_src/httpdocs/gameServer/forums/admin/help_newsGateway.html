    This is the address that Jive will use when exporting guest messages or all

<font size="-1"><b><a name="port" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>NNTP Server Port</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    NNTP servers by default are configured to use port 119, however it is possible
    that the server may be configured to use another port. If that is the case, you
    can configure the newsgroup gateway to use that port when connecting to the NNTP
    server by setting this property.

    If the NNTP server the newsgroup gateway is configured to connect to requires a
    username, you can configure the newsgroup gateway to use a username when
    connecting to the NNTP server by setting this property.

<font size="-1"><b><a name="organization" style="text-decoration:none;"

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Newsgroup messages can have an "Organization" header set which will show up in
    many popular newsreaders such as Microsoft Outlook newsreader. Setting this
    property will cause outbound newsgroup messages to have the Organization header
    set to the value you enter.

</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="honouremail" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Honor user email preference</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true (the default) will cause this gateway to honor user
    preferences to either show or hide their email address depending on the user
    preferences. If the user chooses to not show their email address and this property
    is set to true, the newsgroup gateway will use the 'Default "From" address' property
    as the from address. Setting this property to false will use the user's email address
    as the from address regardless of the users preferences.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="attachments" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Allow import/export of attachments</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will allow this gateway to import and export attachments
    to messages. Importing of attachments will honor any attachment settings you have made.
    <br><i>Note: importing of attachments that cross multiple messages is not supported</i>
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="subjectcheck" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Enabled threading via subject line matching</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will allow this gateway to attempt to create threads through
    matching the subject line with subject lines of messages already imported in the last 60
    days. This is a fall back method of threading when the primary method of using the threading
    headers that normally occur in mail messages are not found.<p>

    Subject line matching will only occur is the subject of the message being imported starts
    with "re:" (case ignored, configurable). If that is not the case, threading via subject line
    matching will not occur.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="tempparent" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Temporary Parent Body</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    It's possible with email accounts, mailing lists and newsgroups to get a response to
    a message before getting the original message. If this happens and only the child
    message is available at the time of the gateway import, Jive must still have a way
    to establish a correct parent/child relationship. Therefore, a temporary fake parent
    message is created using an extrapolated subject from the child, and a body with the
    value given by this property. By default, this value will be an empty string. However,
    you may wish to create a short message that explains the nature of the fake parent
    message to the user.<br>
    On subsequent imports when a real parent message is found, the fake data will be replaced
    with the correct subject and body.
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="debug" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Debug</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will cause the NNTP provider that the newgroup gateway uses
    to output debugging information to the standard output stream. Where that stream show up
    depends on your application server, but often it shows up either on the console or in a
    file called stdout.log
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="importafter" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Import messages after</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to a date in the format of dd/mm/yyyy will cause the gateway to
    import messages that have a date equal to or newer than the date specified.
    <br><i>Note: this option is only available when importing a gateway once.</i>
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="exportafter" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Export messages after</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to a date in the format of dd/mm/yyyy will cause the gateway to
    export messages that have a creation date as old or older than the date specified. One
    note is that the gateway will export a whole thread if any of the messages in the thread
    meet the date criteria. This is done so that the consistency of the thread is preserved.
    <br><i>Note: this option is only available when exporting a gateway once.</i>
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="allowexportagain" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Allow messages to be exported again</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will cause this gateway to reexport messages that have
    already either been imported through the gateway or exported through the gateway.
    <br><i>Note: that Jive created messages are never exported, even if this property is set to
    true.</i>
    <br><i>Note: this option is only available when exporting a gateway once.</i>
    </font>
</ul>

<font size="-1"><b><a name="updatemessageid" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Update NNTP message ID stored in Jive</b></font>
<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Setting this property to true will cause the gateway to update the messageID message
    property stored in Jive upon export of a message. By default, the messageID is stored
    in Jive so that the message won't be reexported or reimported.
    <br><i>Note: This setting has no effect unless the 'Allow messages to be exported
    again' property is also set to true.
    <br><i>Note: this option is only available when exporting a gateway once.</i>
