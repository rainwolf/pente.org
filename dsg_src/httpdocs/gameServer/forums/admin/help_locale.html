<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    Sets the global Jive Forums locale. The locale is used for formatting dates
    and numbers. Additionally, if a language file corresponding to the locale
    is available with the default skin, that language will be used.
    Languages listed in a
    <span style="background-color:#dddddd;">gray background</span>
    represent supported Jive Forums languages. If you choose one of these languages
    the default forum interface will be translated into that language.

<font size="-1"><b><a name="charset" style="text-decoration:none;"

<ul>
    <font size="-1">
    The character set controls how content is encoded and stored in the
    database. The default encoding is ISO-8859-1, which is suitable for
    most Latin languages. If you need to support double byte character sets
    such as Chinese or Japanese, it's recommend that you use utf-8
    as the charset (Unicode). Unicode offers simultaneous support for a
    large number of languages and is easy to convert into native charsets
    as necessary. You may also specifiy any other charset that is supported
    by your JVM. A list of encodings supported by the Sun JVM can be found
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html"
     target="_blank">
    here.</a><p>

    In order for a particular encoding to work (such as Unicode), your
    application server and database may need to be specially configured.
    Please consult your server documentation for more information. For
    example, SQLServer has a special column type for Unicode text, and the
    Resin application server can be configured to use a custom charset by
    adding a &lt;character-encoding&gt; element to the web.xml or resin.conf
    files. Any Servlet 2.3 compliant application servers also supports the
    method HttpServletRequest.setCharacterEncoding(String). A Servlet 2.3
    Filter called SetCharacterEncodingFilter is installed in the default
    Jive Forums web.xml file, which  will set the incoming character encoding
    to global Jive encoding.
