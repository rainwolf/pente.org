Download the db2.jar if you already installed the program and want the most recent code, without downloading the full program again. Overwrite the existing db2.jar in the location you installed the pente db program.<br>

For Mark's AI opening book you can import that file into my program.  It is the opening book that his AI uses, which is pretty sweet!
