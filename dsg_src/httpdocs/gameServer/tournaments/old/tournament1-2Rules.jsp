            The elimination method will use two brackets. A player losing 
            a match will fall from bracket one to bracket two and then 
            upon a second loss of match, from bracket two to elimination 
            as explained below. At the start, all players will be placed 
            into bracket #1 in random order. In each round, each pair 
            of players (#1 vs #2, #3 vs #4 etc) will play each other in 
            a match. If there are an odd number of players in the bracket, 
            the last player does not play that round, but will be moved 
            to the front of the list for the next round. After each round, 
            all players from bracket #1 who lost their match will be moved 
            to bracket #2 in the same order as they were in bracket #1, 
            but after any players already in bracket #2. After each round, 
            all players from bracket #2 who lost their match will be eliminated 
            (having lost twice). The championship round will consist of 
            the winner of bracket #1 vs. the winner of bracket #2. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
            match will consist of two games, each player moving first 
            in one game. If the result is a tie, another two games are 
            played, and then a third pair if necessary. If all three matches 
            are tied, the result is a draw and neither player is eliminated. 
            (If both players agree, they may continue to play matches 
            until a result is determined) Two players who have tied will 
            remain in their bracket, but the one who was listed after 
            the other in the list will be moved to the top or bottom of 
            the list, whichever is further away, to lessen the chances 
            of a rematch. <br>
            <br>
            The time limit of every game will be <b>15 minutes</b> for 
            each player.<br>
            <br>
            Standard tournament times are: <br>
            Saturday: 14:00 GMT (09:00 EST), 19:00 GMT, 24:00 GMT Sunday: 
            06:00 GMT, 12:00 GMT, 19:00 GMT <br>
            Weekdays: 16:00 GMT, 21:00 GMT, 24:00 GMT <br>
            <br>
            You do <b>NOT</b> have to play at a standard tournament time, 
            these are just some times that many people may congregate 
            to play and watch. The time period to play matches in each 
            round will be a period of 10 days, starting on a Friday and 
            ending on a Sunday. You must arrange with your assigned opponent 
            a time to meet and play your match. Be sure to indicate in 
            correspondence, what time zone you are in when discussing 
            times to meet. Players from different countries may wish to 
            express times in GMT. A player who is not able to meet at 
            any time during the match period will forfeit. If two players 
            are unable to agree on a suitable meeting time by the beginning 
            of the match period they must email me - I will assign two 
            different standard times and days for the match to be held. 
            If the players can't agree to either, I will assign one more 
            standard time, either player not able to make it will forfeit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You can send messages to your opponent from dweebo's site. 
            <b>Note</b>: your real email address will be visible to the 
            recipient of your email. If you for some reason do not want 
            your opponent to know your email address, it is possible to 
            send messages to me to be forwarded ( but I don't want to 
            try to handle lots of messages!) <br>
            <br>
            When a game is finished, <b>BOTH</b> players should email 
            the game history to themselves from dweebo's site (Hit the 
            email history button before starting a new game). When a winner 
            is determined, the winner should email ALL games of the match 
            to the referee. Do not panic if you forget to email the history, 
            if both players agree to the winner that is OK. I can recover 
            all games from dweebos site myself if necessary. (Do not attempt 
            to alter game histories, I will recover the original version 
            if there is a discrepancy). I, mmammel, am the referee, 
            all disputes should be sent to me. But I will be playing also, 
            any disputes against me should be sent to the two co-directors: 
            Joe King and happy. dweebo will <b>NOT</b> be a referee, do 
            <b>NOT</b> send him questions or disputes, he is busy enough 
            working on his site.<br>
