               The elimination method will use two brackets. A player losing a match will fall from bracket one
               to bracket two and then upon a second loss of match, from bracket two to elimination as
               explained below. At the start, all players will be placed into bracket #1.<br>
               <br>
               Starting this tournament, the top 4, 8, or 16 players will be seeded according to their rating at
               Pente.org at the start of the tournament. For 8-15 players in the tournament we will seed the top 4
               players, for 16-31 players, seed 8, and for 32-63 players, seed 16. The rest of the players will be
               seeded randomly. In each round, matches will be assigned by pairing the highest seed against the
               lowest, then the next highest vs. the next lowest ( with 12 players: #1 vs #12, #2 vs #11 etc). If
               there are an odd number of players in the bracket, the highest seeded player does not play that
               round (bye). Exception: if the highest seeded player has already had a bye in the tournament, the
               bye will go to the highest seeded player who has not had a bye. We would like to prevent players
               from playing each other a second time until the latest possible time. If players have already played
               one another, there should be as little change as possible in the normal pairing process. Here's an
               example with 6 seeds where #1 and #2 have already played #6, so:
               #1 vs. #5
               #2 vs. #4
               #3 vs. #6<br>
               <br>
               After each round, all players from bracket #1 who lost their match will be moved to bracket #2,
               all players from bracket #2 who lost their match will be eliminated (having lost twice). In the
               next round, the players originally seeded in the top 4, 8, or 16 will remain seeded in the same
               order, the others will be randomly seeded again. Once there is only one player left in bracket
               one, all remaining players will be joined in a single bracket. Play will continue until only one
               player has not lost twice.<br>
               <br>
               The time limit of each game will be 20 minutes for each player. (You should change the time
               from the default 15 minutes). A match will consist of two games, each player moving first in one
               game. If the result is a tie, another two games are played, and then a third pair if necessary. If all
               three matches are tied, play additional matches of 5 minute games until one player wins both
               games of a match.<br>
               <br>
               The time period to play matches in each round will be a period of 10 days, starting on a Friday
               and ending on a Sunday. You must arrange with your assigned opponent a time to meet and play
               your match. Be sure to indicate in correspondence, what time zone you are in when discussing
               times to meet. Players from different countries may wish to express times in GMT. A player who
               is not able to meet at any time during the match period will forfeit. If two players are unable to
               agree on a suitable meeting time by the beginning of the match period they must email me - I will
               assign two different times and days for the match to be held. If the players can't agree to
               either, I will assign one time, either player not able to make it will forfeit.<br>
               <br>
               I, mmammel, am the referee, all disputes should be sent to me. But I will be playing also, any
               disputes against me should be sent to the co-director Joe King.<br>
