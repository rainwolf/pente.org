# This resource bundle file is the default resource bundle that will be
# used by Jive if a resource bundle for a specific Locale cannot be found.
#
# Additional locales can be specified by creating a new resource file in this
# directory using the following conventions:
#
#   jive_i18n "_" language "_" country ".properties"
#   jive_i18n "_" language ".properties"
#
# e.g.
#    jive_i18n_en.properties      <- English resources

#    jive_i18n_de.properties      <- German resources
#    jive_i18n_ja.properties      <- Japanese resources

# Please note that the two digit language code should be lower case, and the
# two digit country code should be in uppercase. Often, it is not necessary to
# specify the country code.

# A full list of language codes can be found at
