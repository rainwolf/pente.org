   <a name="what"><u>What is Java Web Start?</u></a><br>
   From Java's site: Java Web Start is a deployment solution for Java-technology-based applications.
   It is the plumbing between the computer and the Internet that allows the user to
   launch and manage applications right off the Web. Java Web Start provides easy,
   one-click activation of applications, and guarantees that you are always running
   the latest version of the application, eliminating complicated installation or
   upgrade procedures.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="why"><u>Why should I use Java Web Start?</u></a><br>
   If you use Java Web Start, you can download the Game Room only once, then
   each time you want to play you can start it up from your Desktop. No need
   to visit the web site to log in and play! Also, when new versions are
   released from Pente.org, Java Web Start will automatically download the latest
   changes so you'll always be up to date.<br>

   <a name="login"><u>Why do I have to provide my user name and password every time?</u></a><br>
   The applet will auto-log you in using browser cookies, it is not as easy to accomplish
   this with Java Web Start. I will try to add functionality in the future to allow
   storing of login information with Java Web Start.<br>
