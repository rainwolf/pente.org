   After you join, all your information is stored in <b>My Profile</b>.
   You can edit all information in your profile except for your player name, that
   must stay the same. Other players can view the information in your profile as
   well, but only you can modify it.<br>

   If you donate money to Pente.org, you will be able to change the color your name
   displays in when you log into the game room. The color of your name is
   configurable at <b>My Profile</b>. You will also be able to upload a picture
   for your account.<br>
   <br>
   There are also a number of configuration preferences you can modify through
   My Profile | Preferences. You can setup the size for the game room window,
   set a refresh page time for turn-based games and the Who's online page,
   setup how Messages are emailed to you, configure turn-based game settings
   and manage any players who you are ignoring.<br>

   If you are trying to configure the forums, there is a link to <b>Forum
   Settings</b> from <b>My Profile</b>. For example, you may wish to stop
   receiving Pente.org News via email, that is configurable through the forums.<br>
   <br>
   If you no longer wish to play at Pente.org and want to delete your player permanently
   you can also do so through <b>My Profile</b>.<br>
