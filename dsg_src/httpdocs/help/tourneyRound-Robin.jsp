<h2>Round-Robin</h2>

 <ol>
   <li>All players signed up for a tournament will be split up into sections.</li>
   <li>The number of players per section will be 3-5, some sections
       may have 1 less player depending on the number of players in the
       tournament.</li>
   <li>Everyone in a section will play 2 games against every other player
       in the section, one game as player 1, one game as player 2.</li>
   <li>Each win gets you one point, after all players finish their matches,
       the 2 players with the most points are the winners of the section.  If
       2 or more players tie, they are all considered winners.</li>
   <li>Winners advance to the next round of play where the sectioning
       is repeated.</li>
   <li>Eventually there will be a final round with one section, the winner
       of that section is the winner of the tournament.  If there is a tie
       at this point, the same process is used, a new round is created
       and those players who tied will advance and play again until one
       player wins.</li>
   <li>Players will be split up taking into account their rating at Pente.org.
       I know, some players don't like seeded tournaments, but I think
       it is necessary.  Seeding sections
       helps to ensure that a group of highly rated players doesn't all
       end up in the same section.  All players are ranked by their
       rating, then going down the list, players are placed in a section.
       When we reach the final section, we then go back up the list of sections
       adding players.  In a tournament with the right number of players, all
       sections would have the same number of players, and the sum of the seeds
       in a section would be the same for all sections.
       <br>
       <br>
       As a not very realistic example, consider a tournament with 8 players.
       We would start with 2 sections of 4 players each.  The 1st seeded player would
       be placed in section 1.  The 2nd seeded player would be placed in
       section 2.  We've reached the last section, so the 3rd seeded player would
       also be placed in section 2, and the 4th player would be placed in section 1 and
       so on until all 8 players are placed.  The final sections would
       look like this.<br>
       8 players, 2 sections of 4 players<br>
       Section 1: 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th seeds, sum = 1 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 18<br>
       Section 2: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th seeds, sum = 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 18<br>
       This example just illustrates how the sections are determined, but
       doesn't really show why it is done this way, consider instead a
       tournament of 37 players with 4 players per section.<br>
       <br>
       37 players, 10 sections of 4 players/section<br>
       Section 1: 1st, 20th, 21th, 37th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 2: 2nd, 19th, 22th, 36th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 3: 3rd, 18th, 23th, 35th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 4: 4th, 17th, 24th, 34th seeds, sum = 79 <br>
       Section 5: 5th, 16th, 25th, 33th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 6: 6th, 15th, 26th, 32th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 7: 7th, 14th, 27th, 31th seeds, sum = 79<br>
       Section 8: 8th, 13th, 28th seeds, sum = 49<br>
       Section 9: 9th, 12th, 29th seeds, sum = 50<br>
       Section 10: 10th, 11th, 30th seeds, sum = 51<br>
       It should be more obvious now the point of this sectioning. In
       this example the top 20 players all have a decent shot of advancing to
       the next round, and seeds 21,22,23 also have a good chance.  It makes sense
       that the best players in the tournament advance to higher rounds.
       Also, in this example, the last 3 sections only have
       3 players, the higher number sections will always be the ones with smaller
       numbers of players.
