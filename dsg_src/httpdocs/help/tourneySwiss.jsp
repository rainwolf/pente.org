   <ol>
      <li>For round 1, all players are randomly assigned a match with
         another player. If there is an odd number of players, someone
         randomly gets a bye.
      </li>
      <li>Matches are 4 games, each player plays as white twice, and
         black twice. If the result of the match is a tie (2-2), that
         is ok, no further games are required.
      </li>
      <li>For each round, if there is an odd number of players, the
         lowest placed player who hasn't already received a bye, gets
         a bye for the round. A bye gets a 4-0 for the round.
      <li>After round 1, players are then sorted by wins, (and possibly
         secondly opponent wins or some other factor yet to be determined).
      </li>
      <li>So in round 2, if there are two players who are 4-0, they will
         probably be assigned a match. Two players who are 1-3 will also
         probably be assigned a match. This process ensures you are always
         playing another player who is closest to your skill level.
      </li>
      <li>If however, 2 players are
         assigned a match but have already played earlier in the tournament,
         Pente.org will try to find another pairing that haven't played yet, but
         that is still close to the system of pairing by wins.
      </li>
      <li>Play continues for a pre-determined number of rounds, based on
         the number of players. Less than 16 players, 4 rounds, 16-31 players,
         5 rounds, 32-63 players, 6 rounds, 64 or greater players, 7 rounds.
         After the rounds have been played, if there is not a winner
         (one player with most wins) then the top 4 (if 4-5 rounds) or 8
         (if 6-7 rounds) players with the most total wins advances to a
         single elimination playoff to determine the winner.
      </li>
      <li>Vacation time is allowed. If requested in advance of the start of
         the tournament, a player may receive a bye in any one round except
         the final round. This would be considered a half-bye so the player
         will receive a 2-2 for the round.
      </li>
