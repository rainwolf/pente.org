   <h2>Eligibility to play</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>Any player who has <b>established</b> their rating in the game being
         played is eligible. To become established you simply have to play 20
         rated games at Pente.org. There are tournaments that are
         also restricted by rating (e.g., must have rating < 1700 to play).
      </li>
      <li>You must have a valid email address on file, because we use that
         to communicate with you about the tournament.
      </li>
      <li>No player may enter the tournament with more than one ID. If a
         player has more than one user IDs the player should play with the ID
         that has the most games played.
      </li>
