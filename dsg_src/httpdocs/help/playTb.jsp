<h2>Playing Turn-based Games</h2>

Playing turn-based games is a great alternative to playing live games.
Some players prefer to play these games for a variety of reasons.  Here are a few
reasons I like turn-based games.
<ul>
 <li>You can choose to play whenever you like, if you only have a few minutes a day
     you can log in and see what games are ready for you to make a move.</li>
 <li>You can play a very good game, since you and your opponent have lots of time
     to analyze each move (if you want!)</li>
 <li>You can play players who are in different time zones easier.  If you and your
     opponent are on opposite sides of the globe, it can be difficult to find a good
     time for both of you to get on and play a live game.</li>
</ul>
 
<br>
You can start a turn-based game in a few different ways:
<ul>
 <li>Click "Waiting Games" from the main page to see games that other players have
     posted, click the Game name and then click "Accept".</li>
 <li>Create a new game by clicking "Play Turn-based" from the main
     page, then "Start a new game".  You can then invite a specific player or choose
     to post your game to the Waiting games area for anyone to accept.</li>
 <li>Invite a specific player to a game from that players profile</li>
</ul>

Rated turn-based games at Pente.org have one big difference from live games.  Rated turn-based
games must be played in a "set" of 2 games, one game you play as player 1, and one game you
play as player 2.  In order for you to "win" you must win both games.  If you and your
opponent each win one game the set is a draw and no rating change is made.<br>

<h2>Timeouts and vacation</h2>

Turn-based timeouts per move are set to a number of days and take into account weekends and vacation days. 
Weekends are set to Saturday and Sunday by default but this can be changed in your profile.<br><br>
Each player also gets 10 vacation days each year and can, optionally, purchase more. Vacation 
days are floating, this means that when a game is set to timeout, and the player has vacation days 
left, 1 hour is deducted from those vacation days and the timeout is extended by 1 hour. This continues until 
the player runs out of vacation days.
<br><br>
On January 1st of each year, every player's vacation time is reset to 10 days. <br>
