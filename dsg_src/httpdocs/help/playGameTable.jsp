   <h2>Playing - Game Table</h2>

   Once you join or create a new table it will appear in a new window.
   There are a number of buttons and controls in this game table that will
   be explained in detail below. The controls are broken down into the following
   categories:
   <ul>
      <li><a href="#gamePlay">Game Play</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tableOptions">Table Options</a></li>
      <li><a href="#chat">Table Chat and Player List</a></li>
      <li><a href="#gameBoard">Game Board</a></li>
      <li><a href="#gameHistory">Game History</a></li>
      <li><a href="#computer">Computer Opponent</a></li>
   </ul>

   <a name="gamePlay"><u>Game Play</u></a><br>
   There are several buttons that are used during game play. First of all, in
   order to play you and your opponent must let the table know that you are playing
   and that other players in the table are just watching. This is handled as if
   you were at a real game table. Each player that wants to play must "sit" at the
   table by clicking the <b>Sit 1</b> or <b>Sit 2</b> buttons. <b>Sit 1</b> seats
   you as player 1, <b>Sit 2</b> seats you as player 2. Once seated, you can "stand"
   to allow other players to play by clicking <b>Stand</b>. To exit the table, just
   close the window. <b>Note:</b> you can't exit the table if you are currently
   playing in a game.<br>
   <br>
   Once seated, both you and your opponent must notify the table that you wish to
   start a new game. Click the <b>Play</b> button to accomplish this. Once both
   players click <b>Play</b> the game will begin. <b>Note:</b> if you click play,
   and then your opponent changes one of the table options covered in the next
   section (for example, changes the timer from 20:00 to 1:00), then you will have
   to click <b>Play</b> again. This is so you don't get stuck with a nasty player
   who changes things on you and then you have to play in a game you didn't
   mean to start.<br>
   <br>
   Once the game is in progress, there are other buttons that can be used. If you
   make a move that you think was a mistake, you can request the move be undone by
   clicking <b>Undo</b>. Your opponent then can decide whether or not to allow
   the undo. <b>Note:</b> You may wish to discuss your beliefs on
   allowing/disallowing undos with your opponents prior to starting the game to
   avoid frustration. You can also request that the entire game be cancelled
   by clicking the <b>Cancel</b> button. Again, it is up to your opponent to
   accept or reject the cancel request. Finally, if you know you will lose the
   game, you may resign the game by clicking the <b>Resign</b> button. Resigning is
   a time saver and also a display of respect for your opponent.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="tableOptions"><u>Table Options</u></a><br>
   There are a number of options that affect the table, and the game play at the
   table. All options that affect game play can only be changed by the <b>owner</b>
   of the table. A player that joins an empty table is the owner. If later that
   player leaves the table, the player that joined next is declared the new owner
   of the table. A red square is displayed next to the name of the current owner
   of the table in the list of players in the bottom right of the table.<br>
   <br>
   Different games can be played at each table, the available
   games are <b>Pente</b>, <b>Keryo-Pente</b>, <b>Gomoku</b>, <b>D-Pente</b>,
   <b>G-Pente</b>, <b>Poof-Pente</b> and <b>Boat-Pente</b>. Also, each of the above games can be
   played in <b>Speed</b> mode, more on that later. The current game
   being played is displayed in the background of the game board, and can be
   changed with the drop down list in the upper left of the table.<br>
   <br>
   The owner of the table can also decide whether or not the game is rated or not
   using the <b>Rated</b> checkbox. Rated games affect player ratings and also
   enforce additional tournament rules in the case of Pente, Keryo-Pente and Boat-Pente, see
   the <a href="helpWindow.jsp?file=playGameRules">Game Rules</a> for each game for
   more information.<br>
   <br>
   The timers used in the game are also set by the owner of
   the table by clicking the <b>Set Timer</b> button. The timers can be turned on
   or off. If turned on, the timers have 2 parts, initial time and incremental time.
   Initial time is measured in minutes and is the overall time allotted to each
   player. Incremental time is measured in seconds and is added to a player's time
   after each move made by the player. Incremental time is nice to have if you use
   up most of your initial time, at least you have a few seconds of incremental time
   to make each move and not run out of time. If you do run out of time, your
   opponent wins. The timers also determine if the game is classified as a
   <b>Speed</b> game or a normal game. Separate ratings/statistics are kept for
   speed games, see <a href="helpWindow.jsp?file=playGameRules">
   Game Rules</a> for more information.<br>
   <br>
   The owner of the table also controls the table type, it can be either public or
   private. Public tables allow any player to join and watch or play. Private
   tables only allow players to join if they are invited by the owner. To invite
   players click the <b>Invite Player</b> button. If a player is bothering you, you can
   boot the player from the table with the <b>Boot Player</b> button.<br>
   <br>
   The other table options are available to all players, not just the owner of the
   table. These options, available by clicking the <b>Options</b> button, allow
   each player to set their own colors for each player's stones, the option to
   play a sound after each move, the option to highlight the last move made, and
   the option to display the stones with a 3D look or just as flat circles. These
   options will be stored on the pente.org server so you only have to set them up
   once.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="chat"><u>Table Chat and Player List</u></a><br>
   Each table is also a chat room separate from the main room for chat about the
   game or anything else. The chat works the same way as in the main room. There
   is also a listing of all players in the table that works the same way as the
   main room.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="gameBoard"><u>Game Board</u></a><br>
   The game board controls the game and displays the game to all players in the
   table. Moves are made on the table by clicking on the board. When it is your
   turn in the game, a preview of your stone will be displayed as you move your
   mouse around the board before you click. In Pente and variants, captured
   stones are also displayed to the side of the board so you can keep track.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="gameHistory"><u>Game History</u></a><br>
   One of the nicest features of the game table is the game history window,
   located in the upper right. It displays a listing of all moves made in the game
   and also allows you to navigate back and forth through the moves made. By
   clicking on the <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;&gt;</b> buttons
   you will move the game back to the beginning, back one move, forward one move, or
   forward to the current position respectively. You can also click on the move
   you wish to navigate to in the game history window to jump to that specific move.
   If you are viewing a past position of the game, and new moves arrive in the game,
   the game board will flash red to alert you.<br>
   <br>
   Below the game history window is a drop down list to change the type of
   coordinates used on the game board, you can choose either alpha-numeric or
   traditional.
   Alpha-numeric coordinates simply map one side of the grid into numbers 1-19 and the
   other side into letters A-T (<b>Note:</b> letter I is left out to avoid confusion
   with the letter L). Traditional coordinates are slightly more complicated. The
   first move is always represented as '0'. All moves afterwards are relative to
   the center. If the move is L1U3, the move is left 1 grid and up 3 grids from the
   center. Similarly, D3 is down 3 grids from the center.<br>
   <br>
   Also below the game history window is a button to email you a copy of the game
   in text format, click <b>Email Game</b>. The email will go to the email address
   you registered with, to change that email address, go to <b>My Profile</b>.<br>
   <br>
   <a name="computer"><u>Computer Opponent</u></a><br>
   One of the most used features at Pente.org is the computer opponent, created by
   Mark Mammel. The computer opponent is great for beginner players to practice
   against and features 8 different levels. Once you can beat level 8, you will
   probably be ranked at the upper intermediate level. To play against the computer,
   you must be the owner of the table. First sit as player 1 or player 2. Then
   click <b>Play Computer</b> and use the options on the right hand side to invite a
   computer, make sure to tell it to sit at the correct seat. Then, once the
   computer is sitting, click <b>Play</b> to start the game. To dismiss the computer,
   just <b>Boot Player</b> it, it won't mind!<br>
