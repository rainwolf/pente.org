   <h2>Scheduling Games</h2>

   Once a long tournament starts, you will be assigned to play matches against
   other players. You can view all tournament matches from the
   <b>Tournaments In Progress</b> section on the <a href="/gameServer/tournaments">
   main tournament page</a>. Pente.org will also create a new <a href="/gameServer/forums">Forum</a> for each tournament
   and
   matches will be posted there. You will also receive all posts to the
   forum by email. Anyone will be able to view this forum, but only players in
   the tournament can post. You should use the forum to schedule your
   matches with your opponents. When scheduling times, you should always
   indicate what time zone you are in. Pente.org uses the Eastern Standard Time
   (EST), so players might want to use that when expressing times.
   By scheduling matches in the forum, other players
   can know when to show up to watch, and they might also want to schedule
   their games around the same time. Tournament directors also need to
   know when matches are scheduled in case players have problems completing
   their match. If you and your opponent can't finish your match before
   the time limit, the tournament directors decide the outcome, so make
   sure you show up and play.<br>
