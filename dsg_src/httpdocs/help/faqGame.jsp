<a name="tournament"><u>Is it possible to play Pente or Keryo-Pente without the tournament rule?</u></a><br>
Yes, uncheck the <b>Rated</b> checkbox and then you can play Pente or Keryo-Pente
without the tournament rule.<br>
<br>
<a name="gomokuoverline"><u>I placed 6 in a row playing Gomoku and I didn't win?!?!</u></a><br>
One of the rules of Gomoku is that you have to get <b>exactly</b> 5 in a row. This
is not the rule for other 5-in-a-row games (Pente and variations) however.<br>
<br>
<a name="captureafter5"><u>My opponent gets 5 in a row, can I capture to
    stop him/her?</u></a><br>
No, once your opponent gets five in a row, the game is over and you can't make
any additional moves.  Note however that in Boat-Pente you <b>are</b> allowed
to capture to stop a 5 in a row.<br>
<br>
<a name="optionalcapture"><u>I place a stone that allows me to capture
    my opponent's stones. Can I decide to leave his/her stones there?</u></a><br>
No, captured stones must be removed from the board.<br>
