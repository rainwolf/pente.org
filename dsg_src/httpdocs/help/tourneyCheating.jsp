<h2>Cheating</h2>
Cheating of any kind in a tournament at Pente.org is unacceptable, and
 will not be tolerated.  All tournaments games will be monitored.
 We are all just having <b>fun</b>, why does anyone need to cheat?
 You will be immediately disqualified from a
 tournament if you are caught cheating.  If you really want to be
 disqualified though, here is what you should do:
 <ol>
  <li>Enter the tournament with more than one ID.  If a
    player has more than one user IDs the player should play with the ID
    that has the most games played.</li>
  <li>Get assistance from any other person, computer software, notes,
    books, game transcripts, or databases.</li>
  <li>Move pieces (stones) around on any physical or
    computer-based Pente board in order to determine their moves.  If you
    has difficulty in seeing the stones on the Pente board, you may keep
    the game position on any other board of your choosing while the game
    is progressing, but you must not vary the position from the actual game
    position in order to determine possible outcomes of moves.</li>
  <li>Show poor conduct or sportsmanship.</li>
