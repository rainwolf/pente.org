The information you provide is stored in your "player profile".  You can also
provide additional information about yourself for other players to view if you
want, and configure a few things.  You will also be required to enter
your email address to join.<br>

Your player name must contain only letters, digits and the underscore character
and must be 5-10 characters.  The same is true for your password except
passwords can be up to 16 characters.<br>
