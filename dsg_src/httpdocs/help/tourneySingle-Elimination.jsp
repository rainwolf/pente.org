   <h2>Single-Elimination</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>All players signed up for a tournament will be seeded by their
         Pente.org rating.
      </li>
      <li>If there are an odd number of players in a round, the highest
         seed will get a bye. If that player already received a bye in
         an earlier round, the bye will go to the next highest seed who
         hasn't already received a bye in an earlier round.
      </li>
      <li>Then, exluding the bye player, players will be assigned matches
         by placing the #1 seed vs. #last seed, then #2 seed vs.
         #2nd-to-last seed, and so on.
      </li>
      <li>Players play one game as white, one game as black (a set). If
         one player wins both games, that player advances to the next
         round. If the players tie, another set is played, this continues
         until one player wins a set.
      </li>
      <li>The final round will have 2 players, whoever wins that match
         is the winner of the tournament!
      </li>
