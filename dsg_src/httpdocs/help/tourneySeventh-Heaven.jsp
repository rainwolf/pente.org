   <h2>Seventh Heaven Official Rules</h2>

   <b>NOTE:</b> All times listed in these rules shall be in reference to the EST (and EDT, when applicable) time zones.
   Please adjust appropriately for your locality. Note that EST shall switch to EDT on March 14, 2010.
   <br><br>
   <b>ELIGIBILITY:</b><br>
   Please read the rules of this Tournament carefully. It is each player's responsibility to follow these rules and
   procedures and to make themselves available to play at the designated times. If you don't believe that you can meet
   the timeframes outlined in these rules for the duration of the tournament, please do not sign up. "No Shows" are not
   good for tournaments, please do not ruin it for the other players.

   <br><br>
   <b>REPORTING TIME AND PLAYING TIME:</b><br>
   Beginning on the start day (Tuesday) of this tournament, all players shall report to the Tournament Lobby at 9:00 PM.
   The window of opportunity to report for your current day's match opens at 9:00 PM and ends promptly at 10:00 PM. Any
   player who has not reported for their match by 10:01 PM shall forfeit. Matches will begin every Tuesday at this same
   time until the Tournament is complete. Players must be available to play until at least 11:00 PM.

   <br><br>
   <b>COMPLETING OR POSTPONING A MATCH:</b><br>
   Once a match begins, players shall play until one player wins the match, or until a set is completed and results in a
   Draw after 11:00 PM. If the match is still tied after 11:00 PM, either player can demand that the match is postponed.
   If both players agree, they may continue playing another set. A match may not be postponed before 11:00 PM and may
   not be postponed in the middle of a set. If the match is postponed, it shall be resumed the following day between
   9:00 PM and 10:00 PM.

   <br><br>
   <b>REPORTING PROCEDURES:</b><br>
   To sign in for your current day's match, get the attention of a Tournament Director by greeting one in the Tournament
   Lobby, or visiting a Tournament Table where the Director is located and let them know you are present, and make sure
   that the Director acknowledges you. Next, you must immediately create or report to your Tournament Table, Sit, and be
   ready to play. If you cannot locate a Tournament Director, you should immediately post a message in Tournament Forum
   and the timestamp of that message will be proof that you have reported for your match.

   No shenanigans. You must make every effort to report, play and complete your matches.

   <br><br>
   <b>EXCEPTIONS, VACATIONS, BREAKS:</b><br>
   There shall be no exceptions to these rules. Vacation time is not permitted. Failure to report for any match shall
   result in a forfeit. Leaving a match early shall result in a forfeit. Double forfeits will be enforced. A double
   forfeit during the finals will result in No Champion for this Tournament.

   Breaks during a match are permitted between games at the request of either player. All breaks shall be less than 7
   minutes. Breaks of longer than 7 minutes MAY result in a forfeit. A break can also be requested as soon as both
   players have reported for play before the start of the match or before resuming a match. However, play must begin by
   10:00 PM. For a match to be postponed, a set must end AFTER 11:00 PM. Ending a set shortly before 11:00 PM and then
   taking a break does not qualify. In this case, one more set must be played before the match may be postponed.
