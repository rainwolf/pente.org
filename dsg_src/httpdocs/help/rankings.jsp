   <h2>Player Rankings and Profiles</h2>


   For those of you who are competitive, Pente.org keeps track of player ratings and
   rankings for all rated games. You can view the rankings by clicking
   <b>Rankings</b> from the main page. There are a number of different options
   for viewing the rankings, including viewing the rankings for different criteria,
   such as ratings, number of games, etc. There are also a few filtering options
   to filter out players who are provisional, haven't played in the last month, or
   computer players.<br>

   To view a specific player's profile, you can click the link on their name from
   the player rankings, or from other areas of the site. Or enter the player name
   in the search profiles box on the main page and click <b>Go</b>.<br>
