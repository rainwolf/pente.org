<h2>Forums</h2>

Pente.org has discussion forums for players to discuss anything and everything.
The forums have a number of features, such as emoticons, forums searches, spell checking, attachments,
editing later by the author, email notifications and more.  They are also easy to use
and don't require much explanation here, any questions can be posted to the
Help forum!  The only feature worth explaining in detail is the concept of a
<b>Watch</b>, which allows posts to be emailed to you.
