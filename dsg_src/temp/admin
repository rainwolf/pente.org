What do we want admins to be able to do?
- Check logs for a given day for all suspicious activity
- Check IP's of a given player
   (given player check IPs, given IP check players)
- Send warning emails, isn't that just DSGMessage though?
- Deactivate players

From admin area
Cheating section
- Log overview
   scans log dir and provides month, day, year drop downs
   upon selecting one, scan file line by line looking for events
   simply report them on screen, user has to look in files for details
   (or provide events with links, link goes to 100 activity+- event in question)
